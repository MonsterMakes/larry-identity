# Infrastructure Resources

## Setting up Auth0
Follow the below steps to get an Auth0 tenant setup to run `larry-identity`

1. Create an auth 0 tenant

	Visit https://auth0.com/signup and create a tenant.

2. Obtain an Access Token for the management API

	Here are detailed instructions https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tokens. I recommend using the Machine to Machine approach https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/create-m2m-app. If you follow this you will then have a client_id and a client_secret and will be able to use the client credentials flow for the rest of this effort.

	```
	curl --request POST \
	--url https://{{YOUR_TENANT_NAME_HERE}}.auth0.com/oauth/token \
	--header 'content-type: application/json' \
	--data '{"client_id":"{{YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE}}","client_secret":"{{YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE}}","audience":"https://{{YOUR_TENANT_NAME_HERE}}.auth0.com/api/v2/","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
	```

3. Clean up default auth0 stuff (OPTIONAL)

	I reccomend cleaning out the autogenerated stuff to avoid confusion. Go to the auth0 dashboard and follow these steps
	- under Applicatiions delete `Default App`
	- under Connections -> Database delete `Username-Password-Authentication`
	- under Connections -> Social unselect `Google`

4. Setup Custom Email Provider

	If you are using google as the email provider you need to configure less secure access make sure your gsuite administrator has followed the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6260879?hl=en) to "Enable less secure apps to access accounts". This can take up to 24 hours to propoagate. Once that is complete follow these instructions [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) to enable less secure apps for your account. Finally make sure you have 2 factor authentication enabled so you can generate an app specific password. Generate one to be used to send emails on your behalf from auth0.
	
	Once thats all setup...
	
	In the auth0 dashboard go to Emails -> Provider and use the SMTP option.
	- pick whatever alias/group email you'd like to use as the default sender
	- Host is `smtp.gmail.com`
	- Port is `587`
	- Username is your google account email
	- Password is the app specific password generated above

5. At this point you have all the "manual" stup setup and are ready for deployment of a new application environment.

## Deploying a new Cloud Application
To deploy auth0 as an Authorization server for use by `larry-identity` you  will use a combination of REST calls and github projects. Follow the steps below to deploy from scratch

1. Setup the API (MANUAL)

	At this point I do not see a way to create an API programatically. So go into the auth0 dashboard APIs and create an API

	- for Identifier use the common root for your environment, i.e https://dev.mydomain.com

# Developer Resources


## Environment Variables
* API_URI 
	* This is the external URI to this API 
* AUTH0_DEFAULT_CONNECTION
	* The default connection for the Auth Service to connect to.
* AUTH0_DOMAIN
	* This is the uri pointing to the root AUTH0 tenants domain.
* AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
	* This is the id of the AUTH0 application used for authentication.
* AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET 
	* This is the secret of the AUTH0 application used for authentication.
* JWKS_URI
	* This is the uri pointing to the JSON web Key set, see [auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/jwks) for more info.
	* Example
		* https://{{AUTH0_DOMAIN}}/.well-known/jwks.json
* ISSUER
	* This is the issuer (iss claim) of the JWT tokens.
		* In our case this is the AUTH0 tenant's domain
	* Example
		* https://{{AUTH0_DOMAIN}}/
* AUDIENCE
	* This is the OIDC audience (aud claim) 
		* The unique identifier of the AUTH0 API
* AUTH0_ROLE_CLAIM
	* This is the name of the custom claim that contains the user's roles
* AUTH0_ACTIVE_ACCOUNT_ID_CLAIM
	* This is the name of the custom claim that contains the user's active account id

### Set environment shell template
```
export JWKS_URI=https://{{CHANGE_ME}}/.well-known/jwks.json;
export ISSUER=https://{{CHANGE_ME}}/;
export AUDIENCE={{CHANGE_ME}};
export AUTH0_DOMAIN={{CHANGE_ME}};
export AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={{CHANGE_ME}};
export AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET={{CHANGE_ME}};
export API_URI={{CHANGE_ME}};
export AUTH0_DEFAULT_CONNECTION={{CHANGE_ME}};
export AUTH0_ROLE_CLAIM={{CHANGE_ME}};
```

## Remote debugging the dev docker container
- Simply add the code below to your launch.json
```
{
	"type": "node",
	"request": "attach",
	"name": "Attach Debugger",
	"restart": true,
	"protocol": "inspector",
	"address": "127.0.0.1",
	"port": 9229,
	"localRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/",
	"remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app/"
}
```
